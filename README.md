# Fast API benchmark service
Dummy Fast API service with SQL Alchemy setup (postgres as DB). This repo is a part of the thesis project related with a benchmark of python web frameworks/libs.



## Development

Copy env file (from .env.example), start a devcontainer (VS code) and you are (I hope) ready to go.


*To run a server use*:
```sh
./scripts/run_dev.sh
```

*To format and test code with one command use:*
```sh
./scripts/run_checks.sh
```
